Our project, Robotics for Banks, is sponsored by Deloitte in Moscow, Russia.\r\n\r\nTODO Add images, could add brief descriptions(?)\r\n\r\nJacob Bortell\r\n\r\nMichael Giancola\r\n\r\nEverett \"Jack\" Harding\r\n\r\nParmenion Patias\r\n\r\n### Project Description\r\nThe recent global financial crisis has demonstrated the urgent need for new techniques for assessing the health of financial institutions. Because timely identification of banks with poor financial performance is a complex and costly task, this project aims to contribute to the development of automatic procedures for the identification of troubled banks. Students will work under the guidance Deloitteâ€™s Data Analytics Dept. on the creation of a new-generation management robots tool that will automatically monitor performance of banks and identify banks that may experience financial difficulties, which can undermine financial stability of the country. The tool will take advantage of the latest advances in big data research, optimization, cognitive computing, artificial intelligence, statistical models, systems thinking, as well as news monitoring. The project will use publicly available financial and economic databases and real-time news as the primary sources for the data. Such a tool will benefit bank managers as well as bank supervisors including the Central Bank of the Russian Federation.\r\n\r\n### Contact Us\r\nFor any comments or questions, email the team at deloitte@wpi.edu.\r\n",
